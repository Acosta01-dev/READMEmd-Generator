# Markdown Tool

## Introduction

This tool is designed to help users understand and work with Markdown, a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text. With this tool, you can experiment with Markdown syntax and instantly see how it affects your text.

## Features

- Real-time Markdown Preview: As you type, the tool simultaneously displays the Markdown syntax on the left and the live preview on the right, allowing you to visualize the formatting changes.

- Markdown Editing: Write and edit your text using Markdown syntax effortlessly.

## TODO List (Work in Progress)

While the Markdown Tool is functional, there are still improvements and features that we plan to add in the future. Here's a list of things we're currently working on:

-  Enhance Markdown Syntax Support
-  Add support for more Markdown elements (tables, task lists, etc.).
